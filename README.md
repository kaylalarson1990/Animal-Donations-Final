# Animal-Donations-Final

Animal Donations was a Mod 3 final project done in 3 hours. I was given two API's to fetch from - GET and POST were required. Needed to use GET to pull from the animal data and display that on the page. Needed to use POST to be able to submit a new donation.

Technologies used:

* React
* Redux
* Asynchronous Javascript
* CSS
* JSX
* Fetch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goals:

Write clean, dry, flat Redux/React components.

## Challenges:

I had a hard time with the donation form - I was able to get the donations to persist using the POST, however when a user first inputs their name and donation amount, it does not show. Only on refresh does it load the data. Created a github issue for this to come back to!


## Setup:

* git clone https://github.com/kaylalarson1990/Animal-Donations-Final.git
* CD into the directory.
* Run npm install
* Run npm start.
